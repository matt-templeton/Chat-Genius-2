    "No man is capable of causing great evil without thinking he's doing the right thing.",
    "The unexamined life is not worth living.",
    "I drank what?",
    "He who would change the world should first change himself",
    "It is a base thing for a man to wax old in careless self-neglect before he has lifted up his eyes and seen what manner of man he was made to be, in the full perfection of bodily strength and beauty. But these glories are withheld from him who is guilty of self-neglect, for they are not wont to blaze forth unbidden.",
    "Knowledge will make you be free",
    "Is there not one true coin for which all things ought to exchange?- and that is wisdom; and only in exchange for this, and in company with this, is anything truly bought or sold, whether courage, temperance or justice. And is not all true virtue the companion of wisdom, no matter what fears or pleasures or other similar goods or evils may or may not attend her? But the virtue which is made up of these goods, when they are severed from wisdom and exchanged with one another, is a shadow of virtue only, nor is there any freedom or health or truth in her; but in the true exchange there is a purging away of all these things, and temperance, and justice, and courage, and wisdom herself, are a purgation of them.",
    "The poets are only the interpreters of the Gods.",
    "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.",
    "I cannot teach anybody anything. I can only make them think"
